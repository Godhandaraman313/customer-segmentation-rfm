# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
on retail transaction data to identify high-value and at-risk customers.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Monetary value calculation
3. RFM metric computation
4. Percentile-based RFM scoring
5. Customer segmentation
6. Data visualization and interpretation

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A large portion of customers fall under the **At Risk** segment
- **Potential Loyalists** present strong upsell opportunities
- **Loyal customers** form a smaller but high-value group
- Insights can be used for targeted marketing and retention strategies

## 📈 Output
- RFM scores for each customer
- Customer segments (Loyal, Potential, At Risk, Lost)
- Business-ready visualizations

## 📂 Note on Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.
It can be obtained from public retail datasets (e.g., UCI Online Retail Dataset).
